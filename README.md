# Play_with_Cpp
The *Play_with_Cpp* project claims to be accessible for everyone. However, the main target shall be C++ beginners as well as confirmed programmers. It do not (and I will not) try to say that I am a C++ expert, because I am not. So please keep this in mind if you make any suggestion :)


## Organization
The *Play_with_Cpp* project will be organized by projects. Each project shall be used to learn to do something with C++. The something shall be a specific topic useful to most of programs, such as resource management.

Besides the projects, I am writing a Guideline. The guideline aims to:
* propose conventions that any programmer can use to organize and make the code as clear/readable as possible,
* present C++ programming techniques to write efficient code.


## Main contributors
At present, I am the only contributor to the project:
* Arkh42, alias Alexandre Quenon
