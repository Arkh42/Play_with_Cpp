\addchap{Introduction to conventions}

Conventions are rules that are necessary for working as a team with a unified style.
Hence, conventions are often seen as a pure aesthetic discussion.
And often it is the case.

If every member of the team uses a specific style for a specific thing, this thing can be immediately identified by everyone.
As a consequence, conventions are also a mean of improving the efficiency.

Most of the rules are generally admitted as \enquote{good} by experienced programmers.
And indeed, when we see them, we are like: \enquote{this is so obvious!}
